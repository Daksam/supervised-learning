# supervised-learning
This is a supervised learning model my team and I built as part of our internship with Trestle Academy Ghana. We undertook the following steps:
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning, engineering and Imputation
3. Data Normalization and Standardization
4. Classification Model Building (KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers)
5. Model Evaluation (accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report, precision_score, f1_score,roc_curve, auc)
